# 01_Setup
**Topics:** Git, Github, Sourcetree, VSCode, Node.js, NPM/Yarn and Sanity.io

We'll start out quite on the dry and theoretical side. A steep start, but a necessary step. Perhaps we'll manage some fancy *"Hello world"* in the end too?

* Register at Github
* Set up Sourcetree and check out a repo
* Why Git?
* Set up VSCode
* Yarn init
* NPM packages
* Sanity.io boilerplate

Hang in there, this is gonna be abstract, overwhelming, frustratig and fun.
